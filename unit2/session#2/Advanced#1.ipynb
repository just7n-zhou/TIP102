    "### Problem 1: Balanced Art Collection\n",
    "### As the curator of an art gallery, you are organizing a new exhibition. You must ensure the collection of art pieces are balanced to attract the right range of buyers. A balanced collection is one where the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the art pieces is exactly 1.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### Given an integer array art_pieces representing the value of each art piece, write a function find_balanced_subsequence() that returns the length of the longest balanced subsequence.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### A subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements."
