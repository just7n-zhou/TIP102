    "Problem 1: Measuring Loop Length\n",
    "As a trail worker, you've been tasked with measuring the length of a loop trail that circles back to its starting point. Given the head of a linked list trailhead where each node represents a trail marker and the last marker points back to the first marker, return the length of the trail. Assume the length of the trail is equal to the number of markers.\n",
